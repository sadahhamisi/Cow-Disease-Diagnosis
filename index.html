            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a highly infectious viral disease that affects all breeds of cattle and water buffalo. .It is primarily spread by biting insects. Insects such as mosquitoes, biting flies and possibly ticks mechanically transfer the virus. It can also be spread through direct contact between animals via secretions and excretions. Contaminated feed, water, vehicles and iatrogenic means (for example, repeated use of needles on different animals) can all spread the disease.It does not affect other types of livestock or humans.
             Additionally, LSD may be shed in semen and may be present in milk of infected animals.
<h3> Signs and Symptom</h3>
<p>Animals infected with the disease present with fever, depression, and characteristic skin nodules.
Once in a herd, the disease is very difficult to eradicate due to subclinical infections and the presence of insects capable of spreading the virus.
<br>
Clinical signs include:
<ul>
    <li>Firm raised skin nodules up to 50mm in diameter develop around the head, neck, genitals and limbs. Nodules can develop on any part of the body.</li>
    <li>Scabs develop in the centre of the nodules after which the scabs fall off, leaving large holes that may become infected.</li>
    <li>Swelling of limbs, brisket and genitals may occur</li>
    <li>Reluctance to move and eat</li>
    <li>Nasal and ocular discharges</li>
    <li>Enlarged superficial lymph nodes</li>
    <li>Drop in milk production</li>
    <li>Abortion</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Cotrol Measures</h3>
    <p>Flies and mosquitoes as well as ticks play a major role in spreading LSD between animals on the farm and between farms.
    The best way to protect your cattle is by developing and implementing an integrated insect management plan. This involves a targeting all stages of the stable fly and mosquito life cycles to break the breeding cycle.  It also needs to consider tick control.
<b>Effective insect management on-farm includes:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Monitoring larval and adult fly and mosquito numbers to know when to take action</li>
    <li>Environmental management to reduce the number of breeding and resting sites
        For example, fill potholes, remove standing water from containers, and ensure drains are free flowing
    </li>
    <li>Applying larvicide control in large bodies of water</li>
    <li>Applying adulticide control, such as residual spraying and fogging</li>
    <li>Maintaining chemical and mosquito control records</li>
</ul>
